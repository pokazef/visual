This is a binary data viewer based on SDL.

You can think of it as a sort of hexadecimal viewer (like hexedit)
but with a one-pixel font.

It allows you to zoom out, so it can be used to view entire hard-disk
partitions. It refreshes its display in real time, so you can watch
how files are written inside a file system, for example.

Example: ./visual /dev/sda

Keys:
   'a': zoom out
   'z': zoom in
    UP: scroll up slowly
  DOWN: scroll down slowly
  PGUP: scroll up fast
PGDOWN: scroll down fast
   'q': quit
